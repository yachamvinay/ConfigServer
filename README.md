# Spring-Cloud-Configuration-of-Server-and-Client

**This Project is about Spring Cloud Configuration** 
 - We have one server and one client application.
 - In order to communicate both server Server and Client we need to have add Server dependency and Client dependency in application.
 - And more over we have written one thing in seperate file as .yaml file i.e., it just like a json file where what ever information we need to we just write in that file.
 - Most important thing in this projec is we need to give correct uri in both client in order to retrieve the information.
 - To run the project we need to run first Server Application and then Client application.
 - To test the application we need have different controllers I will mention one url
